== Introduction

Asciihero is designed for printed media, so it can't ask for player input.
But sometimes, you might want to prompt users to write things like, and tick a box to help remember something.
For these purposes you can use the input macros.

[.segment]

counter:a[]
counter:a[]
counter:a[]

Every time you enter this segment tick one box.
If all 4 boxes have been ticked, go to turn:segment_2[].

You walk along the old wooden bring and reach the other side, turn to turn:other_side[].
