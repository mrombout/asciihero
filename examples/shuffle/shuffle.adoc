== Introduction

Asciihero can shuffle all segments to appear in a random order if you set the
`:asciihero-shuffle-style:` document attribute to `random`.

If you want the segments to be random, i.e. shuffled but always the same each time you render the document you must set the `:asciihero-shuffle-seed:` attribute to anything.
Asciihero will then use that seed every time it generates a random number for shuffling.
